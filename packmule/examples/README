Testing Utilities For Packmule:

TestPack

testpack.sh holds the simplest run command. Because the script is not versatile, it requires the directory "~/hyve/.iso/" to exist and contain a particular installation image of FreeBSD-11.1. "~/hyve" is where I keep all my VM materials as seen in the "freebsd-tools/vm-util/" directory. As a result, this script is more useful to me than it is to you and I have included it only as a working example.

Config Files

A handful of yaml packing lists are included. These showcase the syntax needed for packmule to install custom content.

YAML Format
